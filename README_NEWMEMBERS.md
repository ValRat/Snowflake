# Tips for New Software Members

Tutorials and advice to help you get started.

## Terminal

First of all, if you're new to the [Ubuntu command line](https://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-quickly-learn-terminal-commands-1494082178): it is primarily used over the graphical user interface as it allows you to do more.

## Github

In case you're new to GitHub, get started with this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Pretty cool right? Now you're wondering how you can use GitHub from the terminal/command line, it's called [Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

## Workflow

Now you're wondering how we develop our software, the first place to start is understanding how our workflow **works.** We use the Forking Workflow, which you can learn more about underÂ **Github Conventions** in `README.md` (located in the same directory you opened this readme from) and other important information you should know. If you have questions, you may find your answers over there. 

## C++

This is the language we use to develop most of our software, so if you are new with C++, understand the fundamentals from this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/), but there are much more resources online as well.

## ROS

By now you understand the basics of ROS, but to learn more about it, you can complete the intermediate tutorials or brush up on the basics if you need to [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

## General Advice

Rarely will your Github issues contain all the information that you need to resolve them. Using google to search for that missing piece you need is sometimes useful (think like an optimist when you're understanding/interpreting your project/issue: "If only I knew how to do...", then search "how to do..."), or of course don't hesitate to ask for help, clarification, or just more information from any of the software leads. 

Remember it is much better to get help when you're stuck than to waste time trying to figure out what's wrong. This way, you're more or less continuously progressing, and as a whole, we develop efficiently and our software stack progresses.
